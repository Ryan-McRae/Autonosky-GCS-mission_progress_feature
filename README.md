# Ground Control Station: Mission Progress Feature

## Overview
During my internship at Autonosky, I contributed to the development of their Ground Control Station (GCS) by implementing a real-time mission progress tracking feature for UAV operations. This feature provides operators with 
live visibility into drone mission completion status.

**Note:** Due to proprietary restrictions and security standards, I cannot share the actual codebase. This repository documents my technical approach, architecture decisions, and implementation strategy.

## Problem Statement
Operators needed real-time visibility into mission completion for each drone in the fleet. While the backend was already streaming waypoint data via WebSockets, there was no UI representation of mission progress.

## My Contribution
I designed and implemented the full-stack feature:
- Extended the WebSocket data handling layer to parse and normalize mission progress data
- Created TypeScript interfaces for type-safe mission progress state management
- Built React UI components to display progress in both the drone card list view and detailed drone panel
- Implemented real-time updates with proper state management and data validation

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **State Management:** React Hooks (custom WebSocket hook)
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets
- **UI Components:** Custom progress bar component
- **Data Flow:** Event-driven architecture

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Backend (Drone) → WebSocket → useWebSocket Hook → State Management → UI Components
                   drone_data   mapRawDrone       DroneData        DroneCard/Detail
```

### Key Components Modified
1. **useWebSocket.ts** - Custom hook for WebSocket connection management
   - Extended `DroneData` interface with mission progress fields
   - Implemented data mapping from raw WebSocket payload to normalized state
   - Added percentage calculation and timestamp normalization logic

2. **DroneCard.tsx** - List view component
   - Displays mission progress summary ("WP X/Y")
   - Renders progress bar for visual feedback
   - Conditionally shown only when mission is active

3. **DroneDetailPanel.tsx** - Expanded detail view
   - Comprehensive mission progress section
   - Shows waypoint count, progress bar, and last update timestamp
   - Human-readable time formatting

## Implementation Highlights

### Type Safety
```typescript
interface MissionProgress {
  currentWaypoint: number;
  totalWaypoints: number;
  percentage: number;      // 0-100, clamped
  lastUpdated: number;     // milliseconds epoch
}
```

### Data Validation & Edge Cases
- Clamped percentage to [0, 100] range to handle edge cases
- Normalized timestamps (handled both seconds and milliseconds epochs)
- Gracefully handled missing or zero waypoint data (hid UI when not applicable)
- Prevented divide-by-zero errors when calculating percentages

### Real-Time Updates
- Leveraged existing WebSocket infrastructure for live data streaming
- Implemented efficient state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Ensured UI responsiveness even with high-frequency telemetry updates

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1:** Backend sent timestamps in inconsistent formats (sometimes seconds, sometimes milliseconds)  
**Solution:** Implemented timestamp normalization logic to detect and convert to milliseconds consistently

**Challenge 2:** Progress percentage could exceed 100% due to race conditions or data anomalies  
**Solution:** Added clamping logic to ensure percentage stays within [0, 100] range

**Challenge 3:** UI needed to handle drones with no active mission gracefully  
**Solution:** Conditional rendering - only display mission progress section when `totalWaypoints > 0`

## What I Learned
- Working with **real-time WebSocket data streams** in production environments
- **TypeScript** best practices for type-safe state management
- **React performance optimization** for high-frequency updates
- **Cross-team collaboration** (worked with backend team on data contract design)
- **Production-ready code** considerations: validation, edge cases, error handling
- **User-centric design** for mission-critical operator interfaces

## Skills Demonstrated
- Full-stack feature implementation (data layer + UI)
- TypeScript/React development
- Real-time data handling (WebSockets)
- State management patterns
- UI/UX design for operational interfaces
- Technical specification interpretation
- Code architecture and data flow design

## Impact
This feature improved operator situational awareness by providing real-time mission progress visibility across the drone fleet, reducing the need for operators to manually track waypoint completion.

**Related Experience:** This project built on my embedded systems work at Autonosky, where I developed firmware for drone telemetry systems. Implementing the GCS frontend helped me understand the full telemetry pipeline from hardware → embedded software → backend → real-time UI.
